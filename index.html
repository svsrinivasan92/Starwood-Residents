        <h3>Starwood Residents</h3>
        <p>
          We, the owners of <strong>Navin's Starwood Towers Phase I</strong> have come together in our angst to create this web page to highlight how Navin’s Housing Properties Pvt Ltd- our builder have repeatedly ignored our rights and sidelined our genuine concerns for their commercial interests - a stark contradiction to their business motto “The Home Makers Who Care”. By documenting our experience here, we hope uninformed home buyers like you may see through this organization and their promises for its emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>The following issues have been repeatedly raised to Navins over the last 4 years since they had completed the construction of Phase I, individually by owners and by elected Association.</p>
        <ul class="issues">
          <li>
            <h5>Exploitation over Clubhouse - Lily of the Valley</h5>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>Navin's has collected 1.5 lakh towards Clubhouse membership from every owner and took over 4 years to complete the construction. Now they demand a minimum yearly subscription of INR 10,000 from each family to use even the basic amenities provided. This is over the very high society maintenance of INR 3.5/Sft that we are charged by them. Our repeated requests to have basic facilities like Gym, Swimming Pool and Childrens Play area free of charge has been rejected.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Unmet OSR Requirements</h5>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>Navin's has not cleared the OSR area required for such a development and are using the area allotted for storing their construction equipment. </p>
            </div>
          </li>
        <li>
          <h5>No play area for children</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>The area provided for children to play is too less and along with the above issue related to OSR, they have no place to play and can be seen playing in driveways and car park, which is causing great discomfort to senior citizens and a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Sub Standard Maintenance</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Navins has not handed over the maintenance to the elected Association yet, stating they will only do so after they sell all the units. However, there is no timelines given to this and we are being charged much higher than many nearby complexes with similar capacity and facilities. We let you be the judge of the quality of their maintenance by taking a look at the photographs below.</p>
            <div class="gallery-wrapper"></div>
            <p>Common toilets are poorly maintained, unattended landscaping of podiums, poorely laid concrete blocks on driveways are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Navinsquality of maintenance. Its easy to understand why they are not getting an Apartment community app implemented, for they do not want to be accountable for the issues getting logged and provide reasonable SLAs to our requests.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Whimsical and impractical Parking Space allotment</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Many house owners were not provided with the accurate blueprint of the parking allotment at the time of purchase. Many have expereinces of having charged for two parking lots, only to realise there is barely space to park another car. Or there are instances where the parking angle is so tight that it requires special skills to navigate without damaging your vehicle.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Poor Quality of Construction</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Several flats are observing leakages within a year of moving in, often caused by the poor civil work done. Washrooms have poor slopes provided resulting Dry areas always wet. Many flats have AC leakages getting reported due to poor considerations in providing AC outlets. Although there is power backup, many flats face issues with inconsistant auto-switching to backup power due to bad electrical equipment used. There are simple unmet practical issues in almost every flat, and what seems like simple fixes are not being done or allowed to be done stating the limitations of Mivan construction technology. </p>
